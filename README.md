<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Main</h3>
<p>
This tool was designed for use by groups with high traffic servers and many admins, but will function just as well 
for small servers.
</p>
<h3>Punishment/Forgiveness System</h3>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This is NOT the player-based punish/forgive system normally used for teamkilling, and is only usable by
admins.<br/>
<br/>
<B>TLDR:</b> Use of punish and forgive commands takes the load off admins remembering what players have broken 
server rules, and how many times. Each time a player is punished it's logged in the database, and the more punishes 
they get the more  severe the punishment. Available punishments include kill, kick, temp-ban 60 minutes, temp-ban 1 
week, and permaban. Order that the punishments are given can be configured to your needs.<br/>
<br/>
After a player is 'punished' (and the Punish log is made in the database), their total points are calculated using 
this basic formula:<br/>
<b>(Punishment Count - Forgiveness Count = Total Points)</b></center><br/>
Then an action is decided using total points from the punishment hierarchy. Punishments should get more harsh as the
player gets more points. A player cannot be punished more than once every 30 seconds, this prevents multiple admins from 
accidentally punishing a player multiple times for the same thing. The punishment hierarchy is configurable to suit 
your needs, but the default is below.<br/>

<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Total Points</b></td>
		<td><b>Punishment Outcome</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Less than 1</b></td>
		<td>Kill</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>1</b></td>
		<td>Kill</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>2</b></td>
		<td>Kill</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>3</b></td>
		<td>Kick</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>4</b></td>
		<td>Kick</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>5</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 60 Minutes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>6</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 60 Minutes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>7</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 1 Week</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>8</b></td>
		<td>Temp-Ban 1 Week</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>9</b></td>
		<td>Perma-Ban</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Greater Than 9</b></td>
		<td>Perma-Ban</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Players may also be 'forgiven', which will reduce their total point value by 1 each time, this is useful if you have a
website where players can apologize for their actions in-game. Players can be forgiven into negative total point values 
which is why a 'less than 1' clause is needed.<br/><br/>

You can run multiple servers with this plugin on the same database, just use different serverIDs for each 
one in plugin settings. If you want punishments to increase on this server when infractions are commited on others set 
"Combine Server Punishments" to true. Rule breaking on another server won't cause increase in punishments on the current 
server if "Combine Server Punishments" is false. This is available since many groups run different rule sets on each 
server they own, so players breaking rules on one server may not know rules on another, so they get a clean slate.
<br/><br/>

When deciding to use this system, 'punish' should be the only command used for player rule-breaking. Other commands 
like kill, or kick are not counted in the system since sometimes players ask to be killed, admins kill/kick themselves, 
or players get kicked for AFKing. Kill and kick should only be used for server management. Direct tban 
and ban are of course still available for hacker/glitching situations, but that is the ONLY time they should be used.
</p>
<h3>Report/CallAdmin System</h3>
<p>
When a player puts in a proper @report or @admin all in-game admins are notified, then the report is logged in the
database with full player names for reporter/target, and the full reason for reporting. All uses of @report and 
@admin with this plugin require players to enter a reason, and will tell them if they haven't entered one. It will 
not send the report to admins unless reports are complete. This cleans up what admins end up seeing for reports 
(useful if admins get reports and admin calls whether they are in-game or not).
<br/>
<h4>Using Report IDs</h4>
All reports are issued a random three digit ID which expires either at the end of each round, or when it is used. These ID's can be used in any 
other action command, simply use that ID instead of a player-name and reason (e.g. waffleman73 baserapes, another player 
reports them and gets report ID 582, admins just use @punish 582 instead of @punish waffleman73 baserape). Confirmation 
of command with @yes is required before a report ID is acted on. Players are thanked for reporting when an admin uses 
their report ID.
</p>
<h3>Admin Assistants</h3>
<p>
When a player sends a report, then an admin uses that report by ID, it is considered a "good" report. When a player 
has X good reports in the past week a small bonus is given, access to teamswap. When a player gets access it simply 
tells them "For your consistent player reporting you now have access to TeamSwap. Type @moveme to swap 
between teams as often as you want." They do not know they are considered an admin assistant, only that they have access to that. The 
assistant list is recalculated at the beginning of each round. They need to keep that report count up to keep access, 
if they have less than the required amount they are automatically removed.<br/><br/>

When an admin assistant sends a report, to the admins that report is prefixed with [AA] to note it as a (most likely) 
reliable report.
</p>
<h3>Player Muting</h3>
<p>
Players can be muted using the mute command, muting lasts until the end of the round. Players who talk in chat after 
being muted will be killed each time they talk (up through 5 chat messages), on the 6th message they are kicked from 
the server. No action other than kill or kick is used by this system. There will be no way to un-mute players, there 
was a reason they were muted, and they can talk again next round. Admins cannot mute other admins.
</p>
<h3>Pre-Yell and Pre-Say</h3>
<p>
A list of editable pre-defined messages can be added in settings, then admins can use the message ID instead of typing 
the whole message in. Example: @presay 2 will call the second pre-defined message, admin is asked to confirm the message 
with @yes to make sure it's the one they wanted.
</p>
<h3>TeamSwap</h3>
<p>
TeamSwap is a server-smart player moving system which offers two major benefits over the default system. Normally when 
trying to move a player to a full team the command just fails at the server level, now the player is dropped on a 
queue until a slot opens on that side. They can keep playing on their side until that slot opens, when it does they 
are immediately slain and moved over to fill it. Secondly it allows whitelisted (non-admin) players the ability to move 
themselves between teams as often as they want (within a ticket count window). This is currently not an available option 
in default battlefield aside from procon commands, the game limits players to one switch per gaming session. Whitelisted 
players can type '@moveme' and teamswap will queue them. This is meant to be available to players outside the admin 
list, usually by paid usage to your community or to clan members only. Admins can also use '@moveme', and in their 
case it bypasses the ticket window restriction.
</p>
<h3>Requiring Reasons</h3>
<p>
All commands which might lead to actions against players are required to have a reason entered, and will cancel if
no reason is given. Players (even the most atrocious in some cases) should know what they were acted on for.
</p>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>
This plugin has been tested on a 64 player Operation Metro server that is full nearly 24/7 and does not cause any 
noticable lag. AdKats is designed to be rather heavy when changing settings, but much lighter when in use. All 
commands are stored in dictionaries so command meanings are parsed instantly when entered. During command parsing 
there is a hierarchy of checks the command goes through (specific to each command), if any of them fail the process 
ends immediately and informs the calling player of the error they made. Database connections are fast and do not cause 
any noticable lag even when logging everything on a very active server.
</p>
<h3>Database Usage</h3>
<p>
You must use an online MySQL database accessible from your procon layer. If you have your own website you can make one 
there, or you can use an online service. My clan runs our own, but I found this online one to be ok, and has a free 
usage option. http://www.freesqldatabase.com/ But any online accessible MySql database will work. Be careful with that 
free option though, the size is limited, and these things can log A LOT of data if it's an active server. When I first 
activated it on a busy metro server we had over 1500 records in just a few days of use.

The plugin checks the database for needed tables on connect. If it doesn't find the proper tables/views it will run 
the script linked below. You can run the script beforehand if you dont want the plugin changing table structure in 
your database.<br/>

</p>
<h3>Available In-Game Commands</h3>
<p>
<u><b>You can edit the text typed for each command to suit your needs in plugin settings.</b></u> Usage of all
commands is database logged by default, but each command can be told whether to log or not. Logging all is useful 
especially when you have to hold 40+ admins accountable, and has not caused any noticable lag.<br/><br/>

<h3>Command Access Levels</h3>
<p>
Players need to be at or above certain access levels to perform commands. Players on the access list can have their 
powers disabled (without removing them from the access list) by lowering their access level. Players can be added to
or removed from the access from plugin settings using the "Add Access" and "Remove Access" text fields. The access 
level of a player can be changed once they are on the access list by modifying the number to the right of their name. 
All players are defaulted to level 6 in the system, and have no special access, level 0 is a full admin.

<h3>Commanding AdKats from Outside the Game</h3>
<p>
If you have an external system (such as a web-based tool with access to bf3 server information), then there are two 
ways to interact with AdKats externally.<br/>

<h4>1. Procon HTTP Server</h4>
Send commands to AdKats through procon's internal HTTP server, it just takes a couple setup steps. Turn on procon's 
HTTP server by going to Tools (Upper right) --> Options --> HTTP Tab and enable the server. The default port should be 
fine for most cases. Then in AdKats settings set the external access key to what you want for a password. Action taken 
is almost instant, and a helpful error message is given if incorrect params are entered. You can then query the plugin 
in following manner.<br/><br/>

<b>The BF3 server ip and port are shown in AdKats settings.</b><br/>
http://[procon_server_ip]:[server_port]/[bf3_server_ip]:[bf3_server_port]/plugins/AdKats/?[Parameters]<br/><br/>

<b>Required Parameters:</b><br/>
command_type=[Command from list Below]<br/>
target_name=[Full or Partial Player Name]<br/>
record_message=[reason for action]<br/>
access_key=[Your Access Key from AdKats Settings]<br/>
<b>Optional Parameters:</b><br/>
source_name=[Name of admin sending this command. This system has access level 1 (full admin) regardless of this entry.]<br/>
record_durationMinutes=[Used for Temp-Bans, duration of time in minutes]<br/><br/>

<b>Example of Command:</b><br/>
http://293.182.39.230:27360/173.199.91.187:25210/plugins/AdKats/?command_type=TempBan&source_name=ColonsEnemy&<br/>
target_name=ColColonCleaner&record_message=Testing&record_durationMinutes=60&access_key=MyPassword<br/><br/>

<b>SECURITY NOTE: As some will notice this works through GET commands, which are insecure, if you issue commands and 
someone outside gets the command URL you entered they will have full access to issue commands on your instance of this 
plugin. It is only insecure if you use this method though, as internally the key is randomized. I am working on securing 
this system, as it is ultimately better than option 2.</b></b>

<h4>2. Adding Database Records</h4>
Have your external system add a row to the record table with a new record to be acted on. All information is needed 
in the row just like the ones sent from AdKats to the database. Just make the 'adkats_read' column for that row = "N" 
and adkats will act on that record. Every ~20 seconds the plugin checks for new input in the table, and will 
act on them if found, this is a much slower acting system than the HTTP server option, but is much MUCH more secure.<br/>

Valid 'command_type's that can be acted on include the following:<br/>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Action To be Performed</b></td>
		<td><b>command_type</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Move Player</b></td>

  have from within AdKats settings, no need to access the database manually. All instances of the plugin on your database 
  will reflect the admins you enter.</li>
  <li><b>Admins now have multiple levels of access.</b> They range from full admin (0) to normal player (6). List of commands for each 
  level is given below. Admins can issue commands at or below their level. Admins of higher level can use commands on 
  lower level admins</li>
  <li><b>HTTP Server Online.</b> Commands can now be sent to AdKats using procon's internal HTTP server, or through the database. 
  Info given below on security of this system.</li>
  <li><b>Player name suggestion system improved.</b> System now considers player names starting with what was typed more correct than those 
  with it just somewhere in their name. System will also perform a "fuzzy" player-name search if the text admins entered is not valid for any players.</li>
  <li><b>Ghost Commands Fixed</b> Commands admins send but don't confirm will be auto-canceled if they move on to other things. This stops 
  unwanted commands from being acted on after the fact.</li>
  <li><b>TeamSwap can now auto-whitelist X random players in the server each round.</b> The random list is changed each 
  round. Use this to generate hype for players to get full access to teamswap. Players are told the first time they 
  spawn that they have access. Players who already have access are not added to the auto-whitelist.</li>
  <li><b>Player report logging improved.</b> Whether a report was used by an admin is now logged.</li>
  <li><b>"Admin Assistant" position added.</b> Players who consistently send useful player reports get a small bonus. 
  Details below. This can be disabled.</li>
  <li><b>Server IDs can be different now, yet still have punishments increase across servers.</b></li>
  <li><b>Added new commands.</b> Kick all Players, and Nuke Server. Details below.</li>
  <li><b>Commands can now operate in shortened hidden mode.</b> When commands are issued in hidden mode they normally 
  require an extra character. e.g. /@kill target reason. They now work with just the slash. e.g. /kill target reason. 
  </li>
  <li><b>Actions against yourself nolonger require a reason.</b></li>
  <li><b>Additional ban message option added.</b> e.g. Optionally add "appeal at www.yoursite.com" to the end of bans.</li>
  <li><b>30 seconds now hardcoded as punishment timeout.</b> Setting was only editable for testing purposes.</li>
  <li><b>Optimizations in code, database, and settings handling.</b></li>
</ul>
